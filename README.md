Krusty Krab :

This is a repo to hold my autotrader module that I plan on expanding in the future and using as a learning module. It takes an API key from Alpaca and based off of a mixture of historical data and live data, will make decisions on what to do with your shares.


            AlpacaAPI	                                 TradingBot
    Fetch current positions.	            Analyze market trends and volatility.

    Fetch market data.	                    Orchestrate the workflow.
    Handle API interactions and errors.	    Handle continuous execution and threading.
